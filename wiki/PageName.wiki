#summary Delphi's cilk.

= Introduction =

Cilk is a general-purpose programming language designed for multithreaded parallel computing.
To implements cilk instruction, we use Delphi's interface called ICilk.
They are very simple:

*var*
  i, j : *integer*;

 newCilk //Create new ICilk interface
 .*spawn*(
   procedure
   begin
     //do some work here...
     i := 42; //result of work
   end)
 .*spawn*(
   procedure
   begin
     //do some work here...
     j := 42; //result of work
   end)
 .*sync*; //wait for i and j calculation well done
 assert(i = 42);
 assert(j = 42);
